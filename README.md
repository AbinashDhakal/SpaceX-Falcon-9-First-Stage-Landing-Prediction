# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landings conducted by SpaceX. The ability to successfully land the first stage is crucial for cost savings in SpaceX launches, making them more economically competitive. The prediction outcomes generated by the model can aid in estimating launch costs and contribute to competitive bidding against other launch service providers.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a Falcon 9 first stage landing will be successful or not. By leveraging historical data and relevant features, the model aims to provide insights into the likelihood of a positive outcome for each launch.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about Falcon 9 launches, including details such as flight number, date, booster version, payload mass, orbit type, launch site, and the outcome of the landing attempt. The data has undergone data wrangling, including handling missing values and categorizing mission outcomes.

## Methodology
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering historical data on Falcon 9 launches, including relevant features.
Data Wrangling: Cleaning and formatting the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigating patterns, distributions, and relationships within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features that contribute to the prediction task.
Model Development: Building and training a predictive model to determine the success of first stage landings.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: Implementing the model for real-time predictions or further analysis.
